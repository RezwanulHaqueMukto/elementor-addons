# Elementor Addons Collection

Hey there! üëã Welcome to my collection of custom Elementor widgets. This repository contains various widgets I've built to extend Elementor's functionality and make web design even more awesome.

## What's Inside?

This addon pack includes custom widgets that aren't available in the standard Elementor library. I built these because, let's be honest, sometimes you need that *one specific thing* that just doesn't exist yet.

### Current Widgets

The `widgets/` folder contains all the custom widgets. Each widget is designed to be:
- **Easy to use** - No confusing settings or overwhelming options
- **Responsive** - Works great on all devices
- **Customizable** - Plenty of styling options to match your design
- **Performance-focused** - Lightweight and fast-loading

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- WordPress 5.0+
- Elementor (Free or Pro) - Latest version recommended
- PHP 7.4 or higher

### Installation

1. **Download** this repository as a ZIP file
2. **Upload** it to your WordPress plugins directory (`/wp-content/plugins/`)
3. **Activate** the plugin through your WordPress admin
4. **Start using** the new widgets in Elementor!

That's it! The widgets will appear in your Elementor editor under their respective categories.

## How to Use

Once activated, you'll find the new widgets in your Elementor editor. Just:

1. Open any page/post with Elementor
2. Look for the new widgets in the elements panel
3. Drag and drop them onto your page
4. Customize using the settings panel
5. Enjoy your enhanced designs! üé®

## Development

### Contributing

### Adding New Widgets

Each widget follows the standard Elementor widget structure:

```php
class Your_Custom_Widget extends \Elementor\Widget_Base {
    // Widget implementation
}
```

Place new widget files in the `widgets/` directory and they'll be automatically loaded.
